            <p>
                Imagine you're in the desert. Sand and dunes surrounding you. It's so hot. You look to your canteen for water, and only see a few drops, but fret not, traveler! You see an oasis ahead: a lovely island flourishing with geysers and flowers... But your journey isn't at end... its just begun.

            <span class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl">What is a hackathon?</span>
            <p>
                A hackathon is a social coding marathon where teenagers¬†come together¬†to¬†build projects¬†for a weekend and¬†share them with the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hack Club Days-of-Service initiative aims to help girls and gender minorities write their first lines of code. Partnering with Girls Scouts across the nation, the DOS initiative approaches Computer Science with beginner-friendly workshops.
